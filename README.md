# BookClub-FrontEnd

## Description

Project to build a full stack MERN application. This application is a book club site that allows you to find a book. It was written using rMVC framework. As someone goes to the page, where they will have the ability to search for a book using keywords (such as author or title of book) or you can do a random search and the application will select a book for you.

Application is deployed on Surge here: http://mern-bookclub.surge.sh/.
The application backend is here: https://github.com/DaveSchuetz/BookClub-BackEnd

## Starting the app

The backend is incorporated on Heroku. When starting the app, it may be a moment before the connection /to Heroku and the database is established. So when starting the application, you will need to wait about 10 seconds before the search and random function.
